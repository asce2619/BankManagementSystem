## General Information
This project required the creation of a simple Bank Account Application. The application created holds one manager and zero to infinite amounts of customers. Each customer holds one bank account with a level associated with the balance they currently have deposited; Silver, Gold, and or Platinum. Managers have the power to add and delete customers. Customers once created by the manager can deposit, withdraw and see their balance and level in their account. Customers can also use their account for online purchases that are $50 and above. Depending on the customer's level they will also be charged an additional tax fee when completing an online transaction.
